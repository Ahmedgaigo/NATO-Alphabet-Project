NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter

The NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter is a Python script designed to convert names or words into their corresponding NATO phonetic alphabet representation. The NATO phonetic alphabet is a system of using specific words to represent individual letters in order to ensure clear and accurate communication, particularly in situations where spoken or radio communication may be challenging.

Features:

1. Data handling: The script reads the NATO phonetic alphabet data from a CSV file (`nato_phonetic_alphabet.csv`) and stores it as a dictionary. This data includes the English alphabet letters and their corresponding NATO phonetic words.

2. User input: The script prompts the user to enter a name or word. The input is then converted to uppercase to ensure consistency.

3. Phonetic conversion: The script converts each letter in the input to its corresponding NATO phonetic word using list comprehension and the dictionary data.

4. Error handling: The script handles situations where non-alphabetic characters or unsupported characters are entered. If an invalid character is encountered, the script displays an error message and prompts the user to enter a valid input.

5. Recursion: In the case of an error, the script utilizes recursion to allow the user to re-enter a valid input and obtain the correct conversion.

To use the NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter, run the script and follow the prompts. Enter the name or word you wish to convert, and the script will display the corresponding NATO phonetic representation. Make sure to enter only alphabetical characters for accurate results.

Note: The NATO phonetic alphabet is commonly used in military, aviation, and telecommunications industries to ensure clear and precise communication.
